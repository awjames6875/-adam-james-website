# Adam James

Adam James builds companies that help people see themselves differently.

Three years after being homeless and living secretly at his job, Adam's companies were generating 7 figures in annual revenue. Today, he is the founder of Safe Harbor Behavioral Health, Integrity Corporate Housing, and Growthgenix.ai—and he's scaling all three.

## Early Life & Background

Adam grew up in Toledo, Ohio—the youngest of ten children, raised by a father who pastored for 65 years. He attended Oral Roberts University, served as a missionary in Cameroon, and later moved to Nice, France, where he worked as a translator in the hospitality industry while mastering the language. When his father died on June 11, 2000, Adam returned home around 2001 and began to rebuild.

## Building & Losing It All

He worked at Key Bank, then Merrill Lynch, then launched a real estate company worth millions. During this season, he also founded Victory Learning Academy—a charter school for at-risk youth still operating today—and started a free tax preparation program for economically disadvantaged families.

Then came the crash of 2009. Adam lost everything.

Homeless and on food stamps, Adam enrolled in personal development training that removed the blind spots holding him back. He completed graduate coursework toward a Master's in Financial Engineering at Kent State University, finishing every course before the program was discontinued. In 2014, he attended the Landmark Forum, a pivotal experience that shifted his perspective. And he started taking action.

With his church and family divided after his father's death, Adam moved to Tulsa, Oklahoma to build his own legacy.

## Tulsa Impact

In Tulsa, Adam became a founding board member of an initiative that raised $4.5 million to build a grocery store in North Tulsa's food desert—work featured in [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/as-dollar-stores-move-into-cities-residents-see-a-steep-downside/2019/02/15/b3676cbe-2f09-11e9-8ad3-9a5b113ecd3c_story.html). 

With 25 years of real estate experience, Adam founded integritycorporatehousing.com in 2015. That same year, he introduced the Airbnb rental arbitrage model on a podcast—the first documented case of the strategy being taught publicly. That innovation grew into Integrity Corporate Housing, now managing over 13 properties across Tulsa, Dallas, Oklahoma City, and New York. At least 15 companies have launched directly from Adam's coaching and mentorship in this space.

## The Fall & The Classroom

Then came the fall.

During COVID-19, Adam made a decision rooted in fear—misrepresenting information on a PPP loan application. He wasn't caught. He turned himself in, returned the money, and took full responsibility. In 2022, he served one year in federal prison.

But prison became the classroom that changed everything.

Adam voluntarily enrolled in RDAP—the Residential Drug Abuse Program—even though he had never taken a drug in his life. He wanted to understand addiction from the inside out, and what he discovered transformed his entire mission. Addiction isn't just about substances. It's about how people see themselves. It's about not having the tools to deal with feelings, stress, and trauma.

Inside those walls, Adam met murderers. Drug dealers. Men who had done terrible things. And he realized something profound: most of them weren't evil—they were untreated. They had never been given tools to process their emotions. Men are taught to suppress what they feel, and when feelings have nowhere to go, they turn into violence, anger, and destruction.

That experience planted a seed. What if these tools weren't just available in prison? What if everyone could access them—before they made the mistakes that landed them here?

## Safe Harbor Is Born

When Adam walked out of federal prison, he hit the ground running. He dove into AI and technology, creating a successful app for behavioral health agencies that transformed how staff operated. And from everything he'd witnessed inside—the unmet needs, the untreated pain, the men who never learned how to feel—Safe Harbor Behavioral Health was born.

The results speak for themselves: Safe Harbor already serves over 150 children and is completing its final phase of licensing next month—making it one of the fastest-growing behavioral health agencies in Oklahoma before even being fully licensed. Through the signature Mind & Body Program, Safe Harbor brings play therapy and mental health tools directly into daycares, nonprofits, and boxing gyms—reaching children and adults before trauma becomes crisis. The mission is simple: when you see yourself better, you do better. And if we can teach kids how to deal with stress, anxiety, and trauma early, they won't have to make the same mistakes Adam made.

## Current Ventures

Adam also founded Growthgenix.ai, helping businesses scale through AI-powered agents and automations. He is currently writing his first book, Identity Theft: Reclaiming Who I Am—a transformational memoir about losing yourself to other people's expectations and finding the courage to take your identity back.

His mission is full circle: from felon to founder to someone who opens doors for others.

## Philosophy

Adam's philosophy is simple: knowledge without action is just an insight. Action is the catalyst for transformation.

Everything he builds exists for the same reason: to give people the space, tools, and opportunity to see their own greatness—not who the world says they are, but who they've always been.

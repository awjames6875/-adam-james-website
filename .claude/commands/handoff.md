Prepare for IDE switch / session handoff.

1. Read docs/memory-bank.md
2. Analyze all changes made this session (check git status, recent edits)
3. Update docs/memory-bank.md with:
   - Current Task (what's in progress)
   - Recent Work (what changed this session)
   - Next Steps (ordered list of what to do next)
   - Files Touched (with one-line descriptions)
   - Decisions & Notes (any new ones)
   - Blockers (if any)
4. Output a brief handoff summary for the user
5. Confirm the memory bank is ready for the next IDE session

# Cursor AI Rules - Adam James Tulsa Website

## 🚀 Session Start Protocol

**CRITICAL**: At the start of EVERY session, read ALL memory bank files IN THIS ORDER:

1. **Read** `memory-bank/projectbrief.md` - Understand project goals and context
2. **Read** `memory-bank/techContext.md` - Learn tech stack and critical file locations
3. **Read** `memory-bank/activeContext.md` - See what's currently being worked on
4. **Read** `memory-bank/progress.md` - Review completed tasks and current status

**Why**: This ensures you understand the full context before making any changes.

## 🛡️ Critical Implementation Rules

### Video Background Implementation ⚠️
**DO NOT MODIFY WITHOUT CAREFUL REVIEW**

The homepage hero section has a critical looping video background:
- **Video file**: `/public/images/adamspeakingengagement.mp4` (12.65 MB)
- **Poster image**: `/public/images/adam-speaking-hero.jpg` (875 KB)
- **Code location**: `app/page.tsx` lines 26-55
- **Required attributes**: ALL 4 MUST be present: `autoPlay`, `muted`, `loop`, `playsInline`

**Before editing this video element**:
1. Read inline comments in `app/page.tsx` (lines 26-45)
2. Read `docs/VIDEO-IMPLEMENTATION.md` completely
3. Understand why each attribute is critical
4. Test on mobile (especially iOS) after any changes

**If video breaks**:
- See `docs/VIDEO-IMPLEMENTATION.md` troubleshooting section
- Check `docs/memory-bank.md` for critical implementation details

### File Location Rules
- ❌ DO NOT move `/public/images/adamspeakingengagement.mp4`
- ❌ DO NOT move `/public/images/adam-speaking-hero.jpg`
- ❌ DO NOT remove hobbies in `/public/images/hobbies/`
- ✅ DO update code paths if you MUST move files
- ✅ DO document any file moves immediately

---

## 📋 Before Making ANY Changes

1. **Review Project Rules**: See `CLAUDE.md` for detailed project rules
2. **Check Critical Details**: See `docs/VIDEO-IMPLEMENTATION.md` if touching video
3. **Read Recent Work**: See `memory-bank/activeContext.md` for current focus
4. **Verify Task List**: See `memory-bank/progress.md` for what's in progress

---

## ✏️ During Work

### Update Memory Bank
- Update `memory-bank/activeContext.md` with your current task
- Mark completed tasks in `memory-bank/progress.md`
- Update frequently (every 1-2 hours of work)

### Code Quality Standards
```bash
npm run lint    # Must pass before committing
npm run build   # Must succeed - no errors
```

### Performance Standards
- **Lighthouse Score**: Never drop below 95
- **Load Time**: Keep under 2 seconds
- **Mobile**: Always test on actual mobile device

---

## 🔄 Before Session End (CRITICAL)

**Use the `/handoff` slash command**:
```
/handoff
```

This will:
1. Ask you to update memory bank with final status
2. Remind you to commit changes
3. Prompt you to push to GitHub

**Do NOT skip this step** - It ensures context is preserved for the next IDE session.

---

- Shows what was done previously
- Asks what to work on next
- **Use at**: Session start OR when picking new task

### `/status` - Quick Status Check

- Reminds you to commit and push
- Prepares context for other IDEs
- **Use at**: End of session, before switching IDEs

### `/start` - Start New Session

## 🎓 Important Notes

### Memory Bank System
- Memory bank is your source of truth
- Always keep it updated
- Use it to maintain context across IDE switches
- The 4 files (projectbrief, techContext, activeContext, progress) work together

### Cross-IDE Consistency
- Use same rules in Cursor, VS Code, and Claude.ai
- Same memory bank structure across all IDEs
- Same slash commands in all environments
- Consistency prevents mistakes and maintains flow

### Video Background
- This is CRITICAL to homepage credibility
- It's been fixed once, don't break it again
- Full documentation exists for a reason
- Always refer to docs before making changes

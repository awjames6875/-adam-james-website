Provide a quick status check of the current project state.

1. Read these files in order:
   - `memory-bank/activeContext.md` - Current work focus
   - `memory-bank/progress.md` - Task status and recent progress

2. Provide a brief summary (5-7 sentences max):
   - **Current Task**: What's being worked on right now
   - **Recent Progress**: Last 3 completed tasks with dates
   - **Blockers**: Any issues or questions blocking progress
   - **Next Action**: What should be done immediately after

3. Keep it concise and focused

4. Do NOT ask what to work on - just show status

5. Do NOT wait for user approval - provide status immediately and be done

Format:
```

**Recent Progress**:

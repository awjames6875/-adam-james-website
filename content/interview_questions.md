# Interview Questions for "My Story" (Chapter 3)

1. "Describe the first moment you saw your name in a headline or on TV. Where were you? What did it say? What did you feel?"

2. "Tell me about a specific time someone treated you differently after they found out - called you something, looked at you a certain way, or rejected you because of the label. What happened?"

3. "What was the moment you decided to STOP agreeing with the labels? Was there a specific trigger?"

4. "Before the charges went public, how did people see you? Give me a specific contrast - how someone treated you before vs. after."

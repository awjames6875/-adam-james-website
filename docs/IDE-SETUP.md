# One-Time Setup for New IDEs

Copy and paste this into any new IDE (VS Code, Cursor, etc.) as your FIRST message when working on this project:

---

```
For this project, follow these rules:

**When I type "resume":**
1. Read docs/memory-bank.md
2. Summarize: Current Task, Recent Work, Next Steps, Files Touched, Decisions & Notes, Blockers
3. Propose a concrete plan to continue
4. Wait for my approval before proceeding

**When I type "handoff":**
1. Analyze all work performed this session
2. Update docs/memory-bank.md with:
   - Current Task (what's in progress)
   - Recent Work (what changed this session)
   - Next Steps (ordered list)
   - Files Touched (with descriptions)
   - Decisions & Notes
   - Blockers
3. Preserve existing history, don't overwrite it
4. Confirm the save is complete

**Always:** Treat docs/memory-bank.md as the single source of truth for project state.
```

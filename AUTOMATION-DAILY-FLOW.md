"Why Small Cities Are the Future of Entrepreneurship

Five years ago, I made a decision that many questioned: I chose to build my businesses in Tulsa, Oklahoma instead of moving to a major metropolitan hub.

Today, I run three thriving companies serving over 1,500 families, and I've never looked back.

Here's what Tulsa offered that big cities couldn't:

1. LOWER OPERATING COSTS
Without crushing overhead, I could reinvest in growth, take calculated risks, and weather early challenges that would have sunk me in an expensive market.

2. AUTHENTIC COMMUNITY  
In Tulsa, business relationships run deep. Partnerships form quickly, referrals are genuine, and your reputation matters.

3. MARKET POSITIONING
Being a standout in Tulsa was far more achievable than being lost in the noise of LA or NYC.

The rise of remote work has proven this thesis: you don't need to be in a major city to build a successful business.

For me, that's Tulsa.

Where are you building? I'd love to hear your story in the comments.
